		For the purposes of this program, all pitches that can be codified can be represented by the following 
		notation [C - Natural *Major* (Zero Octave)] which includes the brackets. In saying "all pitches" what
		is really meant is that there are no pitches within the (foreseeable future of this program) that cannot
		fit within that description. What it DOES NOT mean is that all pitches that have been defined programmatically
		can be described in that way, as the code is still under development. Note that there is no indication of
		the range of the instrument that those pitches can be played on.
		
		This will become increasingly pertinent later on when variable names become less descriptive as music 
		terminology becomes more context specific. The previous text within brackets (exactly as it is written) 
		will be used to describe variable names through comments in code.

	Misunderstood Variables
	{
		{
			What is commented as a ROUGUE VAR in the code are variables that represent something that is currently 
			misunderstood by the current reviewer and also undefined
		}
		{
			What is commented as a VAGABOND VAR in the code are variables that represent something that is currently
			defined, yet misunderstood by the current review 
		}
	}
	{
		What is commented as REVIEWED is code that has been gone through, commented, fixed, or otherwise understood 
		as well enough understood for now (at least during this session)
	}
	Misunderstood Lines
	{
		CLARITY - the code works and can be understood after a significant amount of slow arugment by argument,  
		method by method, reserved word by reserved word, or syntax "symbol" by syntax "symbol" but is lacking in the
		basic meta-requirement of developing that code is easily and (reasonably quickly) read

	Codified Theory Definitions
	ID's
	{
		{
			Pitch #id is equal to some number between a bound minimum and an unbound maximum. The range between those two 
			is equal to the unbound maximum minus zero. Pitch #id = 0 always represents the instruments lowest playable note
			(under typical circumstances). The unbound maximum is unbound because it is not within the foreseeable future that
			any instruments range will need to be defined. To clarify, whenever the issue of range comes up, for the foreseeable
			future, it will be inconsiquential, as there is an assumption that until significant development, only one range
			will be considered.
		}
		{
			Octave-level #id will always be a number from 0-11. It is the number of possible Pitch #id's withina given octave
			(of which there will only ever be twelve notes with consideration given to accidentals
